👨‍💻 Backend Developer

Passionate about crafting scalable backend solutions, I specialize in Python and AWS Cloud services. My expertise lies in building robust REST APIs and optimizing database performance using MySQL, MongoDB, and MSSQL. I excel in Flask, Django, Express, and Node.js for seamless integration and smooth functionality. Additionally, I am proficient in Jenkins for continuous integration, Docker for containerization, and Redis for caching. I also have experience with message brokers like RabbitMQ and possess knowledge of TCP/IP and WebSocket protocols.

🌐 Cloud-Native Enthusiast

Embracing the power of cloud computing, I am constantly exploring innovative ways to leverage AWS services for resilient and efficient applications. From orchestrating microservices to automating deployments, I am committed to staying at the forefront of cloud-native development.

💡 Cross-Platform Visionary

Beyond traditional backend development, I possess a working knowledge of Flutter for cross-platform app development. Furthermore, I am actively learning new technologies like GoLang and Svelte, eager to expand my skill set and tackle exciting challenges.
